    <h1>Indian Cricket History</h1>
    <p id="p1"> A few Indians played as members of the English cricket team while India was under
        British rule,
        including
        Ranjitsinhji and KS Duleepsinhji, before we start with all of the history of Indian Cricket its very important
        to know about the person behind this great history of Indian Cricket.
        Maharaja Of Patiala Sir Bhupinder Singh or Bhuppa best known for his extravagance and for being a cricketer.
        His cricket teams – Patiala XI is among the best of India.
        He was a great patron of sports.<br>
        Maharaja of patiala is the man behind the golden history of Indian Cricket.
        He sponsored various tours of India for cricket and various tournaments using
        his own money. He was captain of the Indian cricket team that visited England in
        1911, and played in 27 first-class cricket matches between 1915 and 1937.<br>
        For the season of 1926/27, he played as a member of Marylebone Cricket Club.
        He donated the Ranji Trophy in honour of Kumar Shri Ranjitsinhji, Jam Sahib of Nawanagar.
        He was selected as the captain of India on its first Test tour of England in 1932, but dropped
        out for reasons of health two weeks before departure and the Maharaja of Porbandar took over.
        <br><br>All this way India becoming the sixth team to be granted test cricket status.
        India made its debut as a Test-cricket-playing-nation in England in 1932 led by CK Nayudu,
        well before Indian independence. The team performed well, with Mohammad Nissar taking 5-93 and 1-42 in
        the match against England. The match was given test status despite being only 3 days in length.
        England, batting first, scored 258 with Nissar cleaning up the openers and tailenders.
        However the Indian team failed to capitalize on their bowling performance, all out for 189 with CK Nayudu the
        top scorer with 40 runs.
        England went on to score 275 and set India a target of 346, which always seemed out of the visitor's grasp.
        India were all out for 187
        and lost by 158 runs.

    <h2>More About Indian Cricket History</h2>
    <p class="Imporant"> India's first ever Test victory came against England at Madras in 1952.
        India's first series victory was against Pakistan later the same year.
        In 1954, India drew a 5-Test series with Pakistan 0–0, the batting strength
        from India had come from Polly Umrigar and Vijay Manjrekar while the prime bowler
        was Subhash Gupte with 21 wickets in the series. India's first series against New
        Zealand in 1956 created a comprehensive series victory for India, winning the 5-Test
        series 2–0. MH Mankad was excellent in his batting, averaging 105.2 in the series while
        scoring 526 runs. Once again, S.M. Gupte held India's bowling together, with 34 wickets.
        The remainder of the 1950s did not show as good results as the start:
        India lost a 3-Test series to Australia (2-0), lost a 5-Test series against the West Indies (3-0),
        The team's performances again began to improve in the 1960s,
        starting with their first series win over England in 1961–62.
        During this time, India's strong record at home started to develop,
        in which the team won a series against New Zealand in 1965-66 and drew
        series against Pakistan, Australia and England. In 1967–68,
        India won their first series outside the subcontinent against New Zealand.
